# Shellsort

Simple shellsort implementation adapted from Algorithms, 4th Ed.  No major changes from the original version.  Small changes which help me
better understand the algorithm.

Decided to compare it to Java system sort and was surprised to find it outperforming system sort.  Only tested arrays of ints, but 
resutls where interesting nonetheless.  See attached text file for timing test results.
